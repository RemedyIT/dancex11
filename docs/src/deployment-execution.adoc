= Deployment execution

== The process

Deployment execution is the process in which a constructed _Deployment
Plan_ is used to direct a selection of runtime tools to distribute,
instantiate, control and/or destruct the component instances described
in the plan.

For the purpose of the execution process the
https://www.omg.org/spec/DEPL[OMG Deployment &
Configuration (D&C) specification] defines the
Execution Management Model. +
 This model specifies the management interfaces and their interaction
patterns with which to implement a D&C compliant deployment runtime.

The Execution Management model defines interfaces grouped according to
the three deployment organization levels also mentioned in the
<<d+c-overview.adoc#,Deployment & Configuration overview>>:

* Domain
* Node
* Locality

Within each of these three levels another subdivision have been made
along the lines of the following separation of concerns: deployment
(level) manager, application (class) manager and application instance
manager. This results in the following defined interfaces:

* At the Domain level:
** ExecutionManager to manage deployment at the domain level
** DomainApplicationManager to manage a plan at the domain level
** DomainApplication to manage a launched plan (application/instance) at
the domain level
* At the Node level:
** NodeManager to manage deployment at the node level
** NodeApplicationManager to manage a plan at the node level
** NodeApplication to manage a launched plan (application/instance) at
the node level
* At the Locality level:
** _Manager_ to manage deployment at the locality level (this interface
is not explicitly specified by D&C)
** ApplicationManager to manage a plan at the locality level
** Application to manage a launched plan (application/instance) at the
locality level

The deployment manager interfaces provide for the functionality to
initiate launching an application (from a plan) and manage the
application managers created. During launch initiation the plan is
validated and analyzed to determine it's composition (nodes, localities,
component instances etc.) and the resources required.

The application manager interfaces provide for the functionality to
start launching an application instance and manage the application
instances created. During the start the application instance and the
instances of all components are created.

The application instance manager interfaces provide for the
functionality to finish launching and starting the application instance.
During launch finalization the created component instances are connected
and configured. Finally the start will activate all component instances.

For shutting down an application (plan) the application manager
interfaces provide the functionality to request the destruction of an
application instance and the deployment manager interfaces provide the
functionality to request the destruction of application manager
instances in turn.

Although the D&C specification does not prohibit launching multiple
application instances DnCX11 currently only supports launching one
application instance for a single plan at anyone time. To relaunch a
plan a previously launched instance has to be shutdown first.

In addition to the functionality mentioned here D&C defines some
additional interfaces aimed at providing functionality for target
(domain) and resource management. DnCX11 does not currently provide
support for these interfaces. For more information concerning these and
the above mentioned interfaces please see the
https://www.omg.org/spec/DEPL[OMG Deployment &
Configuration (D&C) specification].

=== Implementation

The described deployment interfaces for the different levels are most
commonly provided by distinct daemon processes for each separate domain,
node and locality instance specified in the deployment plan.

So for a deployment plan describing a domain consisting of 3 nodes
(NodeA, NodeB and NodeC) and 1 locality for each node a classic setup
would be to have 7 processes running (eventually):

* one Domain Manager process (also called Execution Manager) to direct
the deployment at the domain level
* three Node Manager processes to accept and manage node level
deployment
* three Locality Manager processes for locality level deployment control

The deployment process for the full plan is directed from the Domain
Manager daemon. In DnCX11 the initiator could either be the Domain
Manager itself providing it the plan to deploy at startup *or* the
special Plan Launcher tool which can be used to start a given plan
through an already running Domain Manager daemon waiting in service
mode.

Typically the runtime environment for these processes would be provided
by four separate computing devices, one (central) device for the Domain
Manager and three other devices connected by network links for each
combination of a Node Manager and Locality Manager daemon.

The D&C specification however does not demand any specific implementation
architecture and allows for other setups which may be useful for
different use cases like running complete deployments on single
computing nodes (common for testing) and/or combining deployment
interfaces in a single runtime process.

DnCX11 therefor provides a flexible deployment architecture which allows
for deployments with or without a Plan Launcher, deployment at Domain,
Node or Locality level and running Locality Managers in process with
Node Managers.

== The tools

DnCX11 provides a flexible and configurable runtime framework
implementing all the interfaces mentioned above in a set of executables
and plugin modules.

Although not formally specified the D&C specification leans towards the
notion of centralized, domain level deployment as the default (only?)
mode of deployment. The specification is open enough though to allow for
other interpretations enabling the implementation of support for various
modes of deployment at every conceivable level. The DnCX11 deployment
framework provides such support ready to use.

To drive the deployment process DnCX11 provides two deployment
executables:

* the <<deployment-tools.adoc#_plan_launcher,Plan Launcher>> - `dancex11_plan_launcher` +
 This tool is targeted at multi plan/domain deployments, i.e.
launching/shutting down instances of different deployment plans.
* the <<deployment-tools.adoc#_deployment_manager,Deployment Manager>> - `dancex11_deployment_manager` +
 This tool is the common loader executable for either deployment service
daemons or single plan deployment launchers at the domain, node or
locality level. The common loader integrates with a set of plugin
handlers providing the deployment support for each specific level.

These are supplemented by two plan manipulation tools:

* the <<plan-tools.adoc#_plan_splitter,Plan Splitter>> - `dancex11_split_plan` +
 This tool can be used to split a plan into separate subplans for single
nodes or localities.
* the <<plan-tools.adoc#_plan_converter,Plan Converter>> - `dancex11_convert_plan` +
 This tool can be used to convert deployment plans and domain descriptions
from one descriptor format to another.
