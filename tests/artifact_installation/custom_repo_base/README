This test checks customized artifact installation repository support.
The test uses a custom NM config that defines an argument for the
Artifact Installation Repository Manager specifying to use a custom
repository base folder. The folder indicated is "." which results in
plan repository directories being created directly under the working
directory of the NM launching the plans.
The deployment plan for this test also defines a custom repository folder
named: "my_repo_plan".

This folder is created under the repository base folder
"." on deployment (i.e. in the working directory).

This test deploys a plan with 2 artifacts defined for the LM instance
of the single locality.
The "check_artifacts" script tests if the 2 artifacts have been installed
under the custom installation repository folder after plan launch.
