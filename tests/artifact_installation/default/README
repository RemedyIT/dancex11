This test checks default artifact installation support.
By default the DnCX11 Artifact Installation registry creates a repository
base folder in the working directory of the node manager from which it
is triggered called:

".dancex11_artifacts"

Under this folder the repository creates separate repository directories
for each plan having artifacts installed named after the plan UUID.

This test deploys a plan with default installation settings and 2 artifacts
defined for the LM instance of the single locality.
The "check_artifacts" script tests if the 2 artifacts have been installed
under the default installation repository folder after plan launch.
