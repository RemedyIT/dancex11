These tests verify DnCX11 Artifact installation support.

To enable this support a NM config must be used that loads the following plugins:

- the Artifact Installation Repository Manager service
- 1 or more Artifact Installation protocol handlers (like for file:// or http:// urls)
- the Artifact Instance deployment handler
- optionally; the Artifact Installation initialization interceptor handler
  (provides support for Artifact Installation repository customization)

The "nodemanager.config" file in this directory loads the first three plugins.
The 'custom_repo_base' test has another config file which also loads the last plugin.
