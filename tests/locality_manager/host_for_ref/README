This test verifies the support for the "HostForRef" locality
configuration property.

The LM is confgured to force numeric IP addresses to be used
for host names in IORs which is overruled by the "HostForRef"
property which directs to use "localhost" as Host Name in the IOR.

run_test.pl performs a regular Domain + Node + Locality
deployment.
