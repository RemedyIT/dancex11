This test verifies the DnCX11 support for Node location maps
either in Component Domain Definition (CDD) format or as
CONFIG domain configuration node map.

Also, two ways to specify the Node locations are tested:
1. using a stringified IOR format (specifically the corbaloc
   format here) in 'nodemap.{cdd,cfg}' used by 'run_test.pl'
2. by specifying only network port and address (allowing the
   Domain Manager to apply the most appropriate addressing
   method) in 'nodemap_no_ior.{cdd,cfg}' used by
   'run_test_no_ior.pl'

In addition to testing cdd this test is also capable of testing
the dancex11_convert_plan utility which can convert a plan
or domain description from a cdr,cfg file to a cdr plan
