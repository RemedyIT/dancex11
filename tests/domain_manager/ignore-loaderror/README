This test verifies the DnCX11 Deployment Manager's support for
ignoring load errors for plugins configured for that.

The test utilizes a Domain Manager configuration where the module
name of the CDP plan loader plugin has been changed to an invalid
name and the property nl.remedy.it.DnCX11.ServiceObject.IgnoreLoadError
for the plugin set to true.

The invalid name will cause a load error that should be ignored so the
Domain manager starts successfully.

Launching a CONFIG plan should function properly while launching a CDP
plan should fail (since the CDP loader plugin failed to load).
