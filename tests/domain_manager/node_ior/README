This test verifies the DnCX11 Domain Manager's support for
specifying Node IORs on the commandline.

Also, two ways to specify the Node IORs are tested:
1. by providing a 'file://' URL referencing the files into
   which each NM stored it's stringified IOR
2. by specifying a corbaloc URL directly on the commandline
   for each NM
