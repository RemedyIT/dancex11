This test verifies the support of the Plan Launcher for launching a plan directly through
a Locality Manager daemon.

The test spawns *no* Domain Manager or Node Managers but only a Locality Manager and has
the Plan Launcher connect to the LM directly.

The run_test.pl script uses defaults for the resolution of the LM ApplicationManager and
Application.

The run_test_ior.pl script specifies explicit arguments for the resolution of the LM
ApplicationManager and Application.
