This test verifies the support of the Plan Launcher for launching a plan directly through
a Node Manager daemon.

The test spawns *no* Domain Manager but only a Node Manager daemon and has
the Plan Launcher connect to the NM directly.

The run_test.pl script uses defaults for the resolution of the NM ApplicationManager and
Application.

The run_test_ior.pl script specifies explicit arguments for the resolution of the NM
ApplicationManager and Application.
