This test verifies the support for specification of deployment properties
on the deployment manager commandline.
As this is "common" functionality for any process started with the
DM (either Domain, Node or Locality managers) this test is valid for
any of these.

The test attempts to start the NM daemons providing customized property
settings (instance name&ior file and numeric addresses) for LM spawning
on the commandline.
The "check_lm.sh" test script checks for the existence of the planned
localities as proof that the customized property settings were properly
parsed and propagated.
As the "-N" (or "-ORBDottedDecimalAddresses 1") is *not* passed to the
NM daemons the NM IORs should contain hostnames while the LM IORs should
contain numeric IP addresses as the property
"nl.remedy.it.DnCX11.DM.NumericAddresses" is set to 'true' and passed on
effectively resulting in the addition of the "-N" switch to the LM
commandline when spawned.
The "check_lm.sh" test script checks the IORs exported by the NM and LM
daemons for compliance with the options.
