This test verifies the support for specification of ORB options on the
deployment manager commandline.
As this is "common" functionality for any process started with the
DM (either Domain, Node or Locality managers) this test is valid for
any of these.

The test attempts to start the NM daemons listening at specific ports
specifying the interface and the ports to listen on by passing
corresponding deployment manager switches while also passing (unsupported)
"-ORBListenEndpoints" arguments with incorrect interface/port settings
which should be filtered out to prevent the test from failing.
The Domain Manager used to launch the test plan is provided with explicit
corbaloc IORs for each NM with the specified ports.
The "check_lm.sh" test script checks for the existence of the planned
localities as proof that communication with the NM daemons was successfully
established at the configured addresses/ports.

In addition the "-ORBDottedDecimalAddresses 1" option (supported alternative
for '-N') is passed to the NM daemons on the commandline which should result
in numeric IP addresses in any IORs provided.
The "check_lm.sh" test script checks the IORs exported by the NM daemons
for compliance with this option.
