== What is DnCX11?

**D**eployment a**n**d **C**onfiguration for *X11* *(DnCX11)* is an
implementation of the run-time infrastructure as defined by the
https://www.omg.org/spec/DEPL[OMG Deployment &
Configuration (D&C) specification], which deals with
the configuration and deployment of component-based applications.
Currently DnCX11 is only used for the deployment & configuration of
Lightweight CCM (LwCCM)-based applications, though the framework is
capable of handling other component models as well.

DnCX11 provides a runtime toolset with which distributed, component
based applications can be deployed (installed, configured, and started)
in a target Domain of computing nodes, network links and other
resources.

DnCX11 uses a Deployment Plan (as specified in the D&C specification) to
drive the deployment it performs which can be provided to DnCX11 in
multiple ways including the standardized XML based descriptor format and
a DnCX11 only (easier) text based format (see
<<deployment-planning.adoc#_the_plan,DnCX11 Plan descriptor formats>> for
more information).

Deployment Plan (and Domain) descriptors can be crafted by hand or
automatically generated from Deployment models using tools like
https://github.com/ZeligsoftDev/CX4CBDDS[Zeligsoft CX for CBDDS],
https://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/cosmic/index.shtml[CoSMIC],
and https://www.ptc.com/en/products/plm/plm-products/windchill/modeler[PTC Windchill Modeler].

== Why DnCX11?

DnCX11 provides an improved toolset compared to DAnCE including the
following improvements:

* multiple (and user extensible) plan descriptor formats
* standardized deployment manager loader executables with standardized
arguments
* improved extensibility of toolset through extended plugin options
* dynamic deployment handler framework allows more flexibility in
deployment like in-process localities
* single plan launch option at all deployment levels (Domain, Node and
Locality)
* support for deployment of CIAOX11 components

== OMG D&C compliance of DnCX11

DnCX11 complies fully with the
https://www.omg.org/spec/DEPL[OMG Deployment &
Configuration (D&C) specification] providing the
possibility to easily integrate with other deployment tools complying to
this specification.
